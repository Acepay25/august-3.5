/**
 * Prompt registry — every user-editable prompt in the app.
 *
 * The Settings → Prompts tab renders this list; edits are stored by
 * PromptOverrideService and applied at call time via getPrompt(id, fallback).
 * `fallback` is the built-in default (shown in the editor and used by
 * "Reset to default"). `usage` is a human-readable list of where the prompt
 * reaches a model.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK IS IMPORTED, NEVER RESTATED. An entry used to carry its own
 * copy of the prompt text, and three of those copies had drifted from the
 * constant they shadowed: `strategy.summarize_pdf` was 366 characters short
 * and dropped the mandatory `Family` line, so "Reset to default" installed a
 * prompt that made every uploaded strategy parse with no `strategyFamily`
 * (the field the strategy×regime matrix and the skill attribution both read);
 * `notebook.note` and `notebook.chat_note` were each 107 characters short and
 * missing the line that forbids writing into `skills/`. A restated copy is a
 * drift waiting to happen, so every fallback below is the SAME STRING the
 * call site passes to `getPrompt` — imported, so the two cannot diverge.
 * `tests/planE08PromptRegistry.test.ts` pins that identity.
