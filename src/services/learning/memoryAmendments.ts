/**
 * memoryAmendments — the memory self-correction loop.

 * accumulates forever. This module gives models a second, gated path:
 * apply an amendment (edit or supersede an existing notebook file) DIRECTLY
 * (owner ruling 2026-10-29: no human approval gate). Every applied row keeps
 * the previous and applied bytes, so the log can undo it.
 *
 * Provenance is mandatory: who wrote, when, why, and exactly what changed.
 * Rejected rows are kept (tombstoned) so the same correction's history is
 * visible.
