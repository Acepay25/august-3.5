/**
 * settlementReflection — the ONE bounded model call at trade settlement (E-57 §1).
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Nothing in this app has ever written `trade.postMortem`.
 * The field is read by four live consumers and declared on the row since the
 * first version, and the only writers left are `SqliteService` round-tripping
 * legacy rows and a screenshot upload path. So the leg that turns a closed trade
 * into a notebook lesson has been running on empty text for as long as it has
 * existed: `craftSkillFromPostMortem` (`services/learning/SkillCraftService.ts:144`)
 * returns `null` whenever `postMortem.length < 40`, and `ingestIfThenFromTrade`
 * (`services/learning/SkillMemoryService.ts:3000`) gets zero clauses from
 * `parseIfThenClauses('')`. `services/agents/botLearning.ts:234` still calls the
 * crafter on every closed bot trade and has never once received a skill.
 *
 * **Why one call is allowed.** `docs/plan/README.md` rule 8 said no proposal in
 * the plan adds an LLM review call. The owner waived it for exactly this one,
 * 2026-10-21, because the cost buys back a path the code was already built to
 * run — and everything downstream of it stays human-gated: a reflection becomes a
 * skill DRAFT behind the approval inbox (`services/learning/draftGates.ts`,
 * `utils/skillDrafts.ts`), never a notebook write nobody agreed to.
 *
 * **What it never does.**
 *  - It does not overwrite a note that is already there. A trader's own words win.
 *  - It asks nothing that is not on the row. No new fetch, no new tape: every
 *    fact in the packet was measured and stored by the settlement path itself.
 *  - It writes NOTHING on any failure, decline or malformed answer. A missing
 *    reflection is a gap in the notebook; a fabricated lesson is a lie the
 *    trader then grades their strategy against.
 *  - It runs once per trade per session, and a re-fired settlement never spends
 *    a second call.

Answer ONLY JSON:

  "lesson": "one transferable sentence — what to do differently next time, starting with the thing the trader controls",
  "ifCondition": "the trigger, as a condition the trader can check BEFORE entering (no price you invented)",
  "thenAction": "the mechanical action that trigger should change"

Rules:
- Quote only numbers that are in the record. If a fact is missing, name the absence instead of filling it.
- "ifCondition"/"thenAction" must be checkable and mechanical — a level, a condition, a regime, a size. Not "be more careful", not "trust the feeling".
- A GROSS R that turns NET-negative after fees is a lesson about the stop distance or the entry, not about the direction.
- An outcome that beat its own benchmark is not evidence of skill; a trade that lost while the benchmark rose is not evidence of error. Say which you were told.
- If the record does not support a transferable lesson — an entry that never filled, a one-off execution slip, a row with almost no facts — output {"noLesson": true} and nothing else. A gap in the notebook is better than a rule that was never earned.`;
