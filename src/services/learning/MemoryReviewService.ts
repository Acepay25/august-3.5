/**
 * One-shot notebook review: after Memory files change, the Memory model
 * reads the index and writes profile/suggestions.md for the user.
 * It does not rewrite other files.
 *
 * WHY `profile/suggestions.md` is force-disabled and stays out of retrieval —
 * it is advice addressed to the HUMAN, not a belief about the market. Nothing
 * in this module (or anywhere else) judges its claims, so re-enabling it would
 * feed one model's unsolicited opinion back into the next debate as if it were
 * evidence, and the loop would compound its own advice. Its reader is a
 * person: `components/learn/MemoryFilesManager.tsx:85` renders it in the
 * notebook UI, and it is excluded from the prompt index dump
 * (`MemoryFilesService.ts:277` `SKIP_INDEX_DUMP`), the memory graph
 * (`MemoryGraph.ts:57`) and note search by the same reasoning. Write-only with
 * respect to the model is therefore the design, not an oversight — the file is
 * a one-way message out of the loop.
