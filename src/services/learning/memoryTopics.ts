/**
 * memoryTopics — the topic index over the trader notebook (gap 2 of
 * docs/plan/open-items.md).
 *
 * The reference reads memory as CONTENT: named topics, each with a one-line
 * summary and an "Updated" stamp, into a detail view. August stores memory as
 * FILES in folders, so its memory surface made the user browse storage and
 * read raw markdown to find out what the app believed. This module derives
 * the topic view from the notebook that already exists — no second store, no
 * mirror to drift: every row IS a notebook file, read live on each mount.
 *
 * What counts as a topic:
 *   - a file the TRADER owns (`autoManaged` is the harness's own diary,
 *     profile and rules — those have their own surfaces and regenerate, so
 *     listing them here would promise a Delete that does not stick);
 *   - not a skill (the `skills` folder is the SkillsCatalog's subject — one
 *     record, one surface);
 *   - with content (an empty template is not a belief).
 *
 * Summary rule: the first line of prose, headings skipped. One derivation in
 * one module so the index row and the detail panel can never describe the
 * same file two different ways.
 *
 * THE VOCABULARY LIVES HERE, and it used to live in a component. The list's
 * date column (`memoryUpdatedLabel`) was exported from
 * `components/learn/MemoryTopicsCard.tsx`, and the Settings profile card
 * imported it FROM THAT COMPONENT — a component reaching into another
 * component for a word. It is a vocabulary, so it belongs beside the
 * derivation it belongs to.
