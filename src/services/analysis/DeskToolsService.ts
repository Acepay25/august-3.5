 * naming a shape and to name `draw_on_chart` to make a level visible. The Chat
 * surface's allow-list refuses both calls, so a seat there was told to do a
 * thing its own executor would refuse — which does not read to the model as
 * "this home has no chart", it reads as a duty, and the turn either burns a
 * round trying to fetch it or invents the shape. The offer-list filter already
 * gated the DEFINITIONS; this gates the PROSE, the half no executor refuses.
 *
 * Pass `undefined` for "everything is offered" (the dock, the analysis send).
