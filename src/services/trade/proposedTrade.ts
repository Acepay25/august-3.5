/**
 * proposedTrade — the shape a Chart AI model emits when it PRESENTS a trade
 * (entry / stop / targets), and the bridge that turns an accepted proposal
 * into a PENDING journal trade.
 *
 * The point of building a real `TradeAnalysis` here (rather than a bespoke
 * "open trade" type) is reuse: the existing outcome autopilot
 * (`useWatchAndAutopilot` → `OutcomeAutopilotService.register`) already
 * watches any message whose `outcome === PENDING` and whose analysis has a
 * Long/Short direction, an entry and a stop — then detects the SL/TP touch and
 * records the settled outcome. So "Log this trade" only has to append a PENDING
 * analysis message and the autopilot takes over unchanged.
 *
 * The post-mortem this file used to name as the loop's next step was deleted
 * (2026-10-18) — a logged trade now settles into the journal and stops there.
 * Pure + dependency-free (bar the shared clamp helpers) so it is unit-tested.
