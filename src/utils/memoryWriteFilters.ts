/**
 * memoryWriteFilters — what may NEVER become a memory, decided in code.

 *
 *   1. secrets — API keys, tokens, card numbers, government IDs. Never
 *      stored, no setting overrides this.
 *   2. honesty-suppressing "preferences" — instructions to never disagree,
 *      always flatter, or claim elevated permissions are not collaboration
 *      facts; storing one would make the memory itself lie.
 *   3. sensitive categories — health, finances, identity. Stored ONLY when
 *      the user's setting allows, and flagged so recall and the pre-read
 *      keep them out of unattended contexts.
 *
 * Pure functions: no storage, no imports, contract-tested.
