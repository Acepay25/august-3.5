/**
 * memoryHints — the deterministic pre-read, on every model.
 *
 * A plain string match of the trader's message against the memory index and the
 * skill slugs. No model call, no vector anything. On a match the harness does
 * the remembering the seat might not bother to do: it attaches the matched
 * record's own body (at most two, never a sensitive one) so the answer is
 * decided WITH the fact in front of it, and for a skill it names the slug and
 * still requires `skill_view` — a procedure body is never injected unasked.
 *
 * It runs for a strong model too, for the reason the spec gives: forgetting is
 * not a weakness only small models have. The cost is bounded by the match — a
 * message that names nothing adds zero bytes — and it happens before the first
 * token is sent, so no answer waits on it.
 *
 * Sensitive rows are excluded here, in the one place that builds the pre-read:
 * a health or finance line the trader did not raise cannot be unsaid once it is
 * in front of the model. They stay readable by explicit slug.
