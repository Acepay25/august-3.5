/**
 * The single definition of a PLANNED risk/reward ratio.
 *
 * This app computed R:R four different ways and showed all of them to the
 * user: nearest-TP ÷ stop (analysisUtils), `takeProfits[0]` ÷ stop by ARRAY
 * ORDER (proposedTrade), and highest-TP-hit ÷ stop (the old
 * BacktestingService, retired 2026-10-30). The first two disagree whenever the model emits its
 * targets out of order — which it does — so the same trade could read 1.8R on
 * the card and 3.1R in the journal.
 *
 * Planned R:R is now defined once, here: distance to the take-profit CLOSEST
 * to entry, over distance to the stop. That is the "reward if the first target
 * fills" a trader actually quotes, and it is deliberately independent of array
 * order.
 *
 * The realized ratio in `outcomeEngine.ts` (`realizedRFromPrices`) is a
 * DIFFERENT quantity (which target the market actually reached) and must not
 * be routed through here.

 * whose stop (or whose nearest target) sits on the wrong side of the entry,
 * and a `Math.abs` used to hide exactly that (audit finding F-11: the gate
 * scored R:R from `takeProfits[0]` while the card and the journal quoted the

 * of each re-deriving it. The two are NOT merged: `plannedRiskReward` stays
 * magnitude-based for the card and the journal, and this variant adds the
 * direction the gate needs.
 *
 * **The target selection is the canonical one** — the take-profit nearest the
