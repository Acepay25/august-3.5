/**
 * WireAuditRow — what the wire was actually asked.
 *
 * The transport has ALWAYS decided, for every request, which capability route
 * it applied: an Anthropic thinking block, a Gemini thinking config, an
 * OpenAI effort knob — or none, with a reason. It emitted that decision on
 * every call (`onWireAudit`), and nothing collected it, so the transcript
 * could not answer the one question a trader asks about a missing trace:
 * *did the model not think, or was it never asked to?*
 *
 * This row is the answer, in the transport's own words:
 *
 *  - **No trace.** The summary says so, and says WHY — "no thinking block:
 *    model id not recognized as thinking-capable (set the override in
 *    Settings)". That is the difference between a model that chose not to think
 *    and a request that never asked.
 *  - **A trace.** The summary is the route that was applied; the body lists
 *    every call the turn made, because a turn is several requests and the
 *    last one is not the whole story.
 *
 * It is a disclosure, like every other expander in the app — a native
 * `<details>`, so it is a toggle in every state without JavaScript.
