/**
 * TradeView — August's take on Minara's /app/trade/perps/BTC screen, dark,
 * in the prototype's two-row market header: identity + HERO price (with a
 * 48-bar spark + feed state), then a quiet metrics strip (Mark / Oracle /
 * 24h / Volume / OI / Funding with a depleting-window bar) — over a
 * full-height canvas chart with TradingView-style drawing tools, with the
 * order-book ladder and the live-context Chart AI docked to the
 * right. The dock is drag-resizable, collapsible to a rail and expandable
 * over the chart; its width persists. BELOW LG the three panes (book / chart
 * / AI dock) flatten into an explicit Chart | AI | Book mode switcher — one
 * full-height pane at a time, choice persisted per user. Push-first: one
 * websocket bundle per symbol drives strip + book + candles; REST polling
 * takes over the moment the socket drops (and the chart's own stall watchdog
 * re-syncs a quiet
 * stream), so prices on the chart are realtime or visibly healing.
 * A Chart AI levels card can also push its key levels onto the canvas
 * (chatLevels — transient, coin-stamped, blanked on instrument switch).
 * Presentation only — no order execution.

                The prototype's two rows (hero + metrics strip) merge into one
                row — the reference's 64px instrument bar: hairline-divided
                tape cells, no fills, a control's state is its colour. Every
                reading is the REAL one the two rows carried: mark price, 24h
                change, volume, OI, funding with its countdown and depleting
                window; the tape's 24h high/low come from the same perp ticker
                the change already used (fetchFuturesTicker24h), and the
                oracle reading rides along as the sixth cell rather than being
                dropped. The sparkline left with the merge: the live chart
                sits directly below, and a second small chart of the same data
                was the duplication the reference removes. */}

                    It supplies the WIDTH, the hide-vs-close behaviour, the drag
                    handle and (once a second panel registers) the tab capsules;
                    this surface supplies the layout classes, because below lg the
                    dock is one pane of a three-mode single-column stack rather
                    than a panel — which is why its presentation is pinned to
                    'push'. Letting the contract switch it to 'fullscreen' there
                    would overlay the mode switcher it is supposed to live in.

                    HIDE vs CLOSE. Collapsing used to swap a collapsed rail in for
                    this panel, unmounting it — so the composer draft, the scroll
                    offset and any in-flight turn died with it. Collapsing the dock
                    to look at the chart is an ordinary thing to do mid-analysis,
                    and coming back to an empty dock was data loss wearing a UI
                    costume. The shell keeps it mounted and makes it inert. */}
