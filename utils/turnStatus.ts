/**
 * turnStatus — the ONE answer to "what is this turn doing right now?".
 *
 * WHY A MODULE AND NOT A LABEL IN A COMPONENT. Two surfaces render a turn's
 * work — the Chart AI dock and the Chat surface — and they used to derive the
 * words separately: `ChatWorkTimeline` had its own regex to name the work
 * after the fact, and `ToolActivityRow` had another to pair a call with its
 * result. Two parsers of one grammar is how the summary and the rows stop
 * agreeing, and the summary is the promise the rows have to keep: what the
 * trader reads collapsed is exactly what they get when they open it.
 *
 * So the GRAMMAR lives here, once. `parseToolLine` reads one digest line;
 * `ToolActivityRow` pairs the lines with it, and `turnActivityLabel` and
 * `turnWorkSummary` name the turn with it. One parser, three consumers, and a
 * summary that cannot drift from the rows beneath it.
 *
 * The grammar the desk loop writes (`services/analysis/DeskToolsService.ts`,
 * `digestToolResult`):
 *
 *   `calling order book…`          — a call is in flight
 *   `order book · ETHUSDT · buy wall $1.2M @ 94.8k` — the result
 *   `order book · failed`          — the result, failed
 *
 * The label is the tool's HUMAN label, not its name — the transcript never
 * carries a name. `utils/toolKinds.ts` maps that label to a kind and an
 * activity phrase.
