/**
 * outcomeSettlement — the decision between "detected" and "recorded".
 *
 * The learning loop used to be starved by one human click: the autopilot
 * resolved a trade, and every consumer downstream (skills, calibration, weekly
 * review, provider ranking) read an empty journal until the trader pressed
 * confirm. E-18 makes the write automatic but REVERSIBLE and PROVENANCED.
 *
 * The policy is deliberately a pure table:
 *   - an explicit per-coin 'deny' wins over everything;
 *   - an explicit per-coin 'always' logs immediately;
 *   - an expired-while-open setup is ambiguous and stays a notification;
 *   - otherwise the trader's global mode decides: automatic (15 s + Undo),
 *     shadow (show, do not record), or confirm (notification only).
 *
 * Keeping it pure is what lets the hook and its tests agree about every
 * combination without a timer, a provider, or a mounted component.
