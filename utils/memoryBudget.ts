/**
 * Notebook byte budget — soft / trigger / hard, with the cleanup request
 * deliberately set BETWEEN soft and hard.
 *
 * Why this exists: the whole Trader Notebook is ONE rewritten JSON blob under
 * a single Preferences key (`memory_files_v1_<user>`). Every memory write
 * re-stringifies and replaces it, and the platform can simply refuse: on the
 * web it is the per-origin quota, on desktop the file layer. Until now the only
 * defence was a console warning at 1,000,000 characters, which no screen shows
 * and no code acts on — so the failure mode was a `setPreferenceObject` that
 * throws inside a `catch`, silently stopping persistence while the app carries
 * on believing memory is being written.
 *
 * The unit is UTF-16 code units × 2, not UTF-8. `string.length` already counts
 * UTF-16 code units, so the cost is O(1) per string with no encoder
 * allocation on a hot path that runs on every write — and it is the unit the
 * web origin actually meters its quota in. For a file-backed Preferences layer
 * it overstates ASCII by 2x, which is the safe direction: a budget that reads
 * high asks for help early rather than after the write has failed.
 *
 * Why the tiers act the way they do: this store has NOTHING safe to delete.
 * Every byte in it is either user-written, ledger-owned ("superseded beliefs
 * are never deleted" — `SkillMemoryService.ts` archives merged duplicates
 * rather than removing them for exactly that reason), or derived from a source
 * that is only rebuilt when its own trigger fires, so blanking it would leave a
 * hole in the prompt until that event. So the response to pressure is to
 * REFUSE GROWTH from the unbounded writers and tell a human precisely where the
 * bytes are, never to evict silently. That is the same intent MiniMax Code's
 * between-caps trigger serves — act before the hard cap — adapted to a system
 * where destruction is off the table.
 */

 *  refused outright, so the blob cannot be pushed past what the platform will
