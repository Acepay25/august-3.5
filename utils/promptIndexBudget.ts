/**
 * promptIndexBudget — the ONE budget the skills catalogue and the memory
 * indexes share, scaled to the active model's context window.
 *
 * The indexes are always-on bytes: on a 1M-window frontier model 30 skill
 * lines plus 30 memory lines is noise; on an 8k local model it is the whole
 * prompt. Both composition sites (the Chat surface's `surfacePromptWith` and
 * the dock's seat-prompt builder) read THIS table, so the two homes shrink
 * together and one model's budget never depends on which surface asked.
 *
 * Pure: a window size in, line caps out. Contract-tested.
