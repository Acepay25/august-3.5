/**
 * The registered prompt ids, as BARE STRINGS.
 *
 * `constants/promptRegistry.ts` is the registry, but it IMPORTS the built-in
 * text of all twelve prompts (that is the point of it — the fallback is
 * imported, never restated, so an override and a reset can never disagree with
 * the call site). Pulling it into a run path dragged 1,245 lines of prompt text
 * into the entry chunk: measured at +18.7 kB, which broke the bundle ratchet.
 * `PromptOverrideService.promptCorpusVersion` needs only the NAMES, to decide
 * which stored overrides are still attached to something that reaches a model.
 *
 * So this file is the narrow list, and `tests/promptRegistryIds.test.ts` refuses
 * to let the two drift: an id in the registry but not here is an override that
 * silently stops counting in the corpus fingerprint, and an id here but not in
 * the registry is the orphan this filter exists to drop.
