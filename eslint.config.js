      //
      // 659 -> 385: the 515-file test tree was deleted on 2026-10-23 and the
      // tests/ eslint block carried 267 of the tree's warnings with it.
      // 385 -> 379: the scheduled-automation feature was deleted on 2026-10-24
      // (its own modules carried 6 warnings). Re-measured with
      // `npm run lint:loose`; the cap is re-tightened to the exact count in the
      // same change, which is the only way it keeps binding.
      //
      // It did not, for a long time: the cap sat at 1020 while the tree stood
      // at 949, so 71 warnings could be added and CI would still pass. That is
      // why `tests/hookDestructureHygiene.test.ts` had to exist — the repo was
      // hand-rolling a dead-binding guard because the installed AST rule that
      // already does the job was gated by a cap with slack in it. The guard was
      // removed when the cap was corrected.
      //
      // 949 -> 889: the first cleanup the corrected ratchet made safe. It
      // removed 58 unused imports from App.tsx, whose real dependency surface
      // was 58 names wider than anything in the file actually used.
      //
      // 889 -> 659: the cap had drifted loose again — it stood at 889 against a
      // 659-warning tree, so 230 warnings could be added and CI would still
      // pass. Re-measured with `npm run lint:loose` and re-tightened to the
      // exact count (2026-10-20).
      //
      // App.tsx carries 17 `no-unused-vars` warnings in all: 10 unused LOCAL
      // declarations, plus 7 unused import bindings spread across 5 import
      // statements. The 10 locals are deliberately NOT swept in: each is a
      // hook binding or a destructured return value whose initialiser has to
      // be read before deciding whether removing it removes a computation or
      // a subscription. Pay those down as their files are touched, not in a
      // bulk pass.
      //
      // Re-measure on a clean checkout after touching this file, and LOWER the
      // number when you pay warnings down; never raise it to go green.
      // `npm run lint:loose` lists them without the cap for a cleanup pass.
