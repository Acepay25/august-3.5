/**
 * NotebookWriterService — the AI half of the Trader Notebook.
 *
 * After every closed trade's post-mortem, the harness asks a model to decide
 * what the notebook needs. The model FIRST reads the current notebook index
 * (`getMemoryFilesIndex` — folders, files, excerpts) and then chooses:
 *   - "skip"    → the lesson is already covered or nothing new emerged —
 *                 nothing is written (the notebook never accumulates junk).
 *   - "append"  → an existing file already covers this topic — the note
 *                 becomes a NEW SECTION on that file.
 *   - "create"  → new topic: a new file; a new folder only when the topic
 *                 family has no home.
 * The user keeps full manual control of the notebook alongside.

const NOTEBOOK_NOTE_FALLBACK = `You maintain the trader's notebook — markdown files the AI ensemble reads before EVERY future analysis. After each closed trade you decide whether to write, and how.

The CURRENT NOTEBOOK block below lists every folder and file with a short excerpt. READ IT FIRST — it is the only way to write smartly.

DECIDE:
- "skip" — when this trade's lesson is already fully covered by an existing file, or nothing new or valuable emerged. Writing junk hurts future analyses.
- "append" — when an existing file already covers this topic: your content becomes a NEW SECTION appended to that file (own ## heading, --- separated). Never repeat what that file already says.
- "create" — when the topic is new: a new file. A new folder ONLY when the topic family has no home (market-conditions / rules / lessons are the usual homes). trader-diary is reserved for the automatic diary — never write there.

Content rules:
- Actionable and TIMELESS: what to REPEAT or AVOID next time the same situation appears. No PnL, no dates, no trade ids.
- Written in first person ("When I…", "I will…") as the trader's own lesson.
- 10-40 lines of clean markdown per section: a short heading, 3-8 bullet points, optional "Trigger" / "Invalidates" lines.
- Precise: keep the concrete levels, indicators, regime, and patterns that actually mattered in this trade.

Output ONLY valid JSON with exactly these fields:
{
  "decision": "skip" | "append" | "create",
  "folder": "existing-or-new-kebab-folder",
  "fileName": "short-kebab-name.md",
