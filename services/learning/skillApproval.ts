/**
 * skillApproval — the one place a pending skill draft becomes a live skill.
 *
 * Both approval surfaces (the Coach thread's Save button and the approval
 * inbox) used to run the same six lines inline, and both were wrong in the
 * same way: they DELETED the draft, fired the notebook write with `void`, and
 * toasted "Skill saved" — unconditionally. `ingestCraftedSkill*Unlocked`
 * contains seven bare `return`s that write nothing (no skills folder, a skill
 * already carrying this trigger, an archived twin, an ineligible trade, a
 * rejected trade shape), and `createMemoryFileUnlocked` throws on a name
 * collision. Every one of those left the trader told that a skill existed when
 * none did, with the draft already destroyed so there was no retry.
 *
 * The fix is a read-back, not a new return type threaded through seven exits:
 * ask the library whether this trigger is present AFTER the write, and let
 * that answer — not the call's completion — decide what the UI says. It also
 * covers a future silent return in the ingest path without any change here.
 * This is the repo's standing rule for notebook writes (AGENTS.md): never
 * swallow-and-continue; surface it.
