/**
 * skillReview — the DETERMINISTIC half of "review all my skills".
 *
 * The app has three ways to answer "is this skill file healthy?" and until now
 * they disagreed:
 *
 *  - `listSkills()` (SkillMemoryService.ts) DROPS a file that does not parse.
 *  - the retrieval (MemoryRetrievalService.ts) never sees it either.
 *  - the IMPORT path rejects the same file WITH A REASON (SkillImportService.ts).
 *
 * So one file gets two opposite answers depending on how it arrived, and in
 * the meantime it sits in the notebook, in the backup and in the export,
 * appearing in NO list — including the Health card, whose report already
 * computed the count of files and the count of parsed metas and threw the
 * difference away.
 *
 * This module is that difference, made visible. It is a **pure read**: it
 * mutates nothing, queues nothing, calls no model and needs no provider. It
 * audits every file in the skills folder and returns ONE verdict per file with
 * the evidence behind it.
 *
 * ## The four verdicts
 *
 *  - **ghost** — the file is in the skills folder and does not parse. It is
 *    invisible to every list, so it is reported with the FIRST FAILING LINE,
 *    never a generic "invalid".
 *  - **dormant** — it parses, but it has no structured trigger and its
 *    description is the `serializeSkill` FALLBACK rather than an authored one.
 *    A dormant skill is a WARNING, not a defect: a general rule is *meant* to
 *    be unscoped. It also occupies one of the 30 index slots in file order and
 *    will never fire.
 *  - **clipped** — the recall card (`projectSkillCard`) drops characters, so
 *    the seat gets HALF a procedure in every prompt. The count is reported.
 *  - **fine** — everything checks out.
 *
 * ## What this module deliberately does NOT say
 *
 * "Never fired" is NOT a verdict. The injection log is run-capped
 * (`MemoryInjectionService`, newest-first, `MAX_INJECTION_RECORDS` runs), so
 * absence from it is the same fact as "aged out of the retained window" and
 * most notebook folders are never named in a source record at all. The repo
 * already refuses to conflate "never served" with "aged out"
 * (`memoryHealth.ts:15-18`). So "never observed" is offered only as an
 * OPTIONAL HINT the caller supplies — this module never reads the log, so it
 * can never make that claim on its own.
 *
 * ## The repairs
 *
 * A repair is a PROPOSAL, never an application. The one this module can build
 * without a model is a ghost reconstruction: the file's OWN words (its H1 and
 * its first prose line) put back into a valid frontmatter, with the counters
 * at ZERO and the status `candidate` — so a repaired ghost can never claim
 * evidence it never earned. Everything else (writing a real trigger for a
 * dormant skill, shortening a clipped body) needs a model and is stage 2.
 *
 * Both halves go through the existing human approval queue
 * (`utils/learningQueue.ts` → `components/learn/ActionApprovals.tsx`).
