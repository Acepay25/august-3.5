/**
 * profileMemory — August's counterpart to this coding agent's memory system.
 *
 * The trader NOTEBOOK (MemoryFilesService) remembers what the MARKET taught
 * the models. This remembers what the USER taught the assistant — the small,
 * durable facts about the collaboration itself, in the same shape this
 * environment's memory has:
 *
 *   • one fact per entry, with a short kebab-case slug, a one-line
 *     description (used to decide relevance), and a body holding the fact;
 *   • four kinds — 'user' (who they are), 'feedback' (how they want the
 *     assistant to work — bodies carry **Why** + **How to apply**),
 *     'project' (ongoing work/constraints not derivable from the journal),
 *     'reference' (pointers to external things);
 *   • the INDEX (slug + one-line description per entry) is injected into
 *     every Chart AI system prompt and every analysis-pipeline memory block —
 *     always loaded, like this environment's MEMORY.md;
 *   • bodies are pulled on demand via the read_memory desk tool, not dumped;
 *   • the model maintains it itself: remember (upsert by slug — update over
 *     duplicate), forget (wrong memories get deleted, not left to rot).
 *
 * Per-user localStorage blob (`profile_memory_v1_${user}`), bounded — same
 * persistence grain as learningQueue/chatSessions, so no new storage path.
