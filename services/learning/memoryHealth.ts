/**
 * memoryHealth — one pure read over every memory surface (WS-4.3).
 *
 * The learning loop writes into a dozen places (notebook folders, skills,
 * drafts, proposals, amendments, forged tools, the graveyard, settled
 * beliefs) and until now each had its own surface to inspect it, so nobody
 * could answer "is memory actually healthy?" in one look. This is that answer:
 * a selector, not a service — it mutates nothing, queues nothing, and is safe
 * to call on every render of the Health tab.
 *
 * Staleness is measured against the ONE signal that exists: the injection log
 * (`MemoryInjectionService`, newest-first, capped at `MAX_INJECTION_RECORDS`
 * runs). Two different facts come out of it and they are kept apart on
 * purpose:
 *  - `staleFiles` — a file the log DOES place a hit on, whose newest hit is
 *    older than `STALE_FILE_DAYS`. That is the real "no hits in N days".
 *  - `unobserved` — a file with no hit inside the retained window. Absence
 *    from a run-capped log is not the same as never being served (the hit may
 *    simply have aged out, and most notebook folders are never named in a
 *    source record at all), so these are reported as unobserved — with their
 *    days-since-edit — and never folded into the stale count.
