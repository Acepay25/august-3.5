// transaction", and one flow's ROLLBACK then rolled back the OTHER flow's

 * queueing it — the deadlock-free re-entry.
 *
 * Why this is threaded explicitly rather than detected: the queue is a plain
 * promise chain with no ambient async context (no AsyncLocalStorage in the
 * browser/WebView), and "the queue is busy" is NOT the same question — while
 * flow A's body is suspended at an await, flow B may call in and would be
 * told it is A. A global "is the lock held" flag therefore lets two unrelated
 * flows run concurrently, which is exactly the overlap this mutex exists to
 * prevent. The permit only exists inside a runExclusiveWrite body, so
 * composing a nested writer is a deliberate, type-checked act, and a
 * forgotten permit fails as a deadlocked test rather than as silent
 * corruption in production.
