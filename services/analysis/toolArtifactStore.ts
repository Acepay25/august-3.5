/**
 * toolArtifactStore — keep the WHOLE tool payload so a clip is a pause, not a
 * loss.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. A desk-tool result is capped before it reaches a model
 * (`budgetToolContent`: 2400 chars, more for the compendium tools). The cap is
 * necessary — tool output rides every subsequent prompt, so one 200 KB order
 * book compounds across a whole debate — but it means a seat asking about the
 * 92nd level of a book is told, correctly, that it was dropped. Before this the
 * dropped bytes were DESTROYED at that moment: even the 30-second result cache
 * held the clipped copy. So "MISSING, not absent" was honest and useless: the
 * seat could know the rest existed and still never get it.
 *
 * THIS FIXES IT BY. Keeping the pre-cap payload addressable and putting an
 * address in the truncation notice, with a `read_tool_output` tool that serves
 * any slice of it. The model's second move on a clipped result is to fetch the
 * rest instead of reasoning around the gap.
 *
 * WHY IN MEMORY AND NOT ON DISK, despite the reference harness writing spill
 * files: a CLI session runs for hours across many processes, so its artifacts
 * have to outlive the run. An August debate is minutes long, its tool payloads
 * are market snapshots that are WRONG an hour later, and the app's persistent
 * layer is one rewritten JSON blob this app already has a byte budget for.
 * Writing per-call megabytes of stale order books into it would be a regression
 * dressed as a feature. So the store is bounded, aged, and cleared at every
 * debate start beside the result cache it mirrors.
 *
 * The one rule that must not be bent: `budgetToolContent` promises the returned
 * string fits its cap, and callers size `tailReserve` so their live-price
 * stamps land INSIDE that budget. A receipt appended after the fact would
 * breach exactly that promise — which is a bug this repo has already been bitten
 * by once. The locator is therefore REPORTED BEFORE the cap is applied, via
 * `receiptCostFor`, and carved out of it.
