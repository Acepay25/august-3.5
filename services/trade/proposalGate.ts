/**
 * proposalGate — the gate scan that bounds a presented plan.
 *
 * Why this exists at a tool call at all: the gate used to be a PIPELINE stage, so
 * the confidence cap only bound a verdict the multi-seat run produced. Once a
 * model can put a trade on the table by calling `present_trade`, the cap has to
 * bind THAT path too — otherwise a tool-proposed plan reaches the journal with a
 * probability no scan ever approved.
 *
 * Why it is CONCURRENT rather than blocking: the scan is market data plus an OHLCV
 * pull per timeframe. Awaiting it inside the tool call delays the plan's own
 * drawing and its "Log this trade" card by seconds, on a path that never touched
 * the network before. So `present_trade` starts the scan and shows the levels
 * immediately (no probability, no confidence, no grade until the stamp lands),
 * and the LOG path — a human deciding, seconds or minutes later — awaits the same
 * in-flight scan. Nothing uncapped is ever recorded, and nothing waits on a fetch.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `quickGateCheck`: that helper folds a FAILED FETCH into
 * `pass: false, confidenceCap: 0`. Here that would report a live idea as a 0%
 * one for the length of a network blip, and 0 is a measurement, not an absence.
 * Splitting fetch from scoring keeps "measured low" and "could not measure" two
 * different facts.
