/**
 * proposalDisposition — the ONE memory of what the trader already did with a
 * presented plan.
 *
 * A plan's card is per-row: clicking "Log this trade" must not write a second
 * journal row on a re-click, and dismissing it must not bring it back on the
 * next render. That state lived in `ChatTranscriptList` at module scope so it
 * survived a dock unmount/remount — which is also exactly why the Agents surface
 * could not share it: the store was welded to the dock's file. Stage 20b puts
 * the card in both homes, so the map lives here and both surfaces read it.
 *
 * Keyed by the ROW id, which `entriesForSession` guarantees is the same id in
 * both homes (`liveEntryFromMessage` projects by `m.id`), so logging a plan on
 * the chart marks it logged in Chat and vice versa — one decision, one record.
