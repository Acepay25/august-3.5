/**
 * chatStore — the Chart AI dock's session state, hoisted OUT of React so an
 * in-flight answer survives a surface switch. The trade surface is mounted
 * only while its tab is active, so a plain useState panel would unmount (and
 * its unmount-cleanup abort) the moment the user glanced at the Journal — the
 * stream died mid-sentence. Living in a module singleton instead: the run
 * keeps streaming into the store while the panel is gone, and remounting
 * re-subscribes to the SAME live entries (streaming text resumes on screen).
 *
 * Also owns the per-session AbortControllers (so switching tabs never aborts
 * another session's run — only an explicit Stop or deleting a session does),
 * the debounced persistence into chatSessions (streaming flags stripped, so a
 * half-finished answer is never written to storage), and the HARNESS SIGNAL
 * QUEUE: level-watch price events land here, not in a component ref, so a hit
 * that arrives while a run is busy — or while the dock is unmounted — is
 * never dropped; the panel flushes the queue when the session goes idle.
 *
 * Persistence is user-scoped and honest about it: the store remembers WHICH
 * user it loaded for and refuses to write the previous user's chats into the
 * newly active user's key — a detected switch rehydrates from the new key
 * instead. A `storage` listener keeps two windows of the same user from
 * silently clobbering each other (refresh when idle; a live stream wins).
