/**
 * presentTradeTool — the ONE `present_trade` executor, shared by both chat homes.
 *
 * This branch used to live inside the Chart AI dock's `executePanelTool`, where
 * it was welded to a `chatStore` entry, a live canvas and the level-watch. The
 * Agents surface cannot present a plan without it, and copying it would have been
 * a second answer to "what did the model propose" — the exact split stage 20
 * exists to close. So the TRANSITION lives here and every side-effect goes
 * through a sink the calling row owns.
 *
 * The receipts are the contract, and four honesty tests in
 * `tests/tradeChatPanelHarness.test.tsx` pin them: a plan already through its
 * stop/target gets REFUSED, a live one gets the watch promise, a cross-canvas
 * turn keeps the stale-stamp note, and a same-coin canvas adds no note. The
 * rule that makes those four agree is that the receipt describes the SAME
 * `arm()` call the surface is about to make — including the null anchor the
 * chart uses off-view, and including "nothing is watching" when the caller has
 * no watch to arm.
