/**
 * THE ONE MERGE — one thread, whichever home it is read from.
 *
 * Both homes write, and that is not going to change: the dock's turn runner
 * streams into a session's `entries` (~40 write sites in `chatTurnRunner.ts`,
 * each with tool lines, reasoning traces and a streaming flag), while the Chat
 * surface's turns settle into App `messages` — the record the Journal, the
 * analyses gallery and the learning loop read, and the only one rich enough to
 * carry `analysis`, `planId`, `debateTurns` and `runStats`. Replacing either
 * writer with the other would cost the dock its streaming state or the trader
 * their verdict cards.
 *
 * So the thread is a READ model over both, keyed by id, and the id is the trick
 * that makes two writers safe: `liveEntryFromMessage` keys a projected row by
 * `m.id`, and the `present_trade` path already writes the dock entry under the
 * SAME id as the conversation Message (`chatStore.findSessionByEntryId`), so a
 * turn that exists twice is one row here, not a duplicate. That is also why
 * this must be the only merge in the app — a second one would be a second
 * answer to "what did we say", which is the split this closes.
 *
 * Rules, inherited from the merge this replaces in `TradeChatPanel`:
 *  - canonical rows first, in conversation order;
 *  - a local row whose id already exists REPLACES it (the settling turn carries
 *    the dock's richer chrome), never appends — appending is what made every
 *    exchange appear twice;
 *  - a local row with no canonical counterpart joins at the end: a chart-side
 *    tool round, a harness notice, or the answer still streaming, which reaches
 *    `messages` only once it settles.
 *
 * `canonical` undefined ⇒ the session has no counterpart and its own entries
 * are the whole transcript. That is a chart-side session with no
 * `conversationId` — a conversation of its own, with its own tool rounds and
 * key levels — so a reload can never invent a merge the trader never had.
