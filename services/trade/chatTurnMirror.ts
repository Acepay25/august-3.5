/**
 * chatTurnMirror — the Chart AI dock's live turn, mirrored into the App
 * conversation, so BOTH homes show the same answer arriving.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The two homes had one merge and one writer each: the dock
 * streamed into its session's `entries`, and the Chat surface streamed into
 * `Message.isStreaming` + `text`. `commitSoloChatTurn` only ever wrote the
 * conversation at SETTLE, so a turn started in Chart AI was invisible to the
 * Chat surface until it finished — switch across mid-generation and the thread
 * showed the question and nothing else, with no sign the desk was working. The
 * reverse direction already worked (`liveEntryFromMessage` projects the
 * conversation's rows into the dock), which made the asymmetry look like a
 * broken switch rather than a missing writer.
 *
 * WHY A MIRROR AND NOT ONE STORE. The dock's entry is the richer row while the
 * turn runs — it carries the tool trail, the payload ids and the reasoning as
 * they land — and the conversation is the record everything else reads (the
 * Journal, the gallery, the learning loop). Replacing either writer was already
 * ruled out in `entriesForSession`'s note. So the dock keeps streaming into its
 * own entry and this module copies that entry into the conversation under the
 * SAME id, which is what makes one turn one row in both homes.
 *
 * THREE things this must not get wrong:
 *  - **It never uses requestAnimationFrame.** The generating surface is the one
 *    that is HIDDEN while the trader reads the other, and a rAF-driven writer
 *    fires zero times in a hidden tab — the exact defect `FadingText` records.
 *    A timer keeps the conversation current whether or not the dock is on screen.
 *  - **It always flushes.** A turn that fails or is stopped mid-stream leaves an
 *    `isStreaming: true` row in the conversation with nothing after it if the
 *    last patch is dropped, so `stop()` commits synchronously.
 *  - **It commits by id, and only for its own entry.** A retry drops the stale
 *    answer and re-runs under a new entry id; the old mirror stops, and the
 *    conversation's row for it is the settle commit's business, not this one's.
