/**
 * toolTurn — ONE model turn against the desk-tool transport.
 *
 * This is the half of `runSeatTurn` that was never about the dock: stream a
 * reply, let the model call tools while it does, keep its reasoning out of the
 * answer channel, and settle the row honestly. It lived inside the Chart AI
 * panel's session machinery, so the Chat surface could not get tool calls
 * without copying that machinery — and a second copy is how two homes start
 * disagreeing about one turn.
 *
 * The executor owns the TRANSITION; the caller owns the ROW. How a turn is
 * stored (a dock `LiveEntry` with `tools`/`toolIds`, a canonical `Message` with
 * `thoughtProcesses`) stays behind `ToolTurnEvents`, because the two row types
 * do not share those fields — `Message` has no `tools`/`toolIds` at all, which
 * is why this is an event sink and not one shared state object.
 *
 * Four behaviours here each cost a bug to learn; do not "simplify" them:
 *  - the abort check runs BEFORE the echo repair, or a deliberate Stop is
 *    reported as a failure ("it cancelled" became "could not answer");
 *  - the settle reads STRIPPED text, or a text-protocol tool call reaches the
 *    transcript as literal protocol soup;
 *  - the splitter only acts when it really peeled something, or a clean answer
 *    that happens to open with "Verdict:" gets eaten;
 *  - `resetText` fires on a bounced malformed call, because what streamed so
 *    far was the attempt, not the answer.
