/**
 * watchService — the "watch or schedule" harness the MODEL drives: it arms
 * price watches and time wakes through the watch_price / wake_me desk tools,
 * and when a condition holds (or the deadline lapses) it queues the harness
 * record into chatStore ITSELF (the thread that armed the watch runs it as a
 * model turn → the model alerts the user); subscribers carry only the OS ping,
 * so no record depends on a component being mounted. Same singleton shape as
 * levelWatchService/PriceAlertService.
 *
 * CONTRACT: advisory only — it never trades, resolves or logs anything. It
 * wakes the model; the model decides what the alert says.
 *
 * Fire-once + lapse: a watch fires exactly once and is then removed (its
 * note may not survive contact with a re-ping). A price watch whose deadline
 * passes first LAPSES — it is removed, persisted, and one `expired` event goes
 * to the same subscribers a fire uses, so the thread that armed it learns the
 * wait ended with nothing to report. Armed watches persist per user in
 * localStorage
 * (`trade_watches_v1_${user}`, capped), so "check back in 30 minutes" survives
 * a reload — and firing needs a live clock: the service runs its own 1s
 * interval while ANY watch is armed. Price watches ride the visible chart
 * feed's tick() when it covers their symbol, and the same clock REST-polls
 * the mark price (Binance futures premiumIndex, ~5s per symbol) for the
 * non-visible ones — before that, a watch armed while the chart pointed at
 * another coin could never see a tick for its symbol and silently expired
 * (Tier-0 #6).
 *
 * STALE IS NOT NEWS (owner ruling, 2026-10-22). A price watch whose condition
 * the tape ALREADY satisfies is refused at arm time rather than fired on the
 * spot, and a watch hydrated from a previous session whose level is already
 * met by the FIRST mark seen after the reload is dropped without emitting. Both
 * cases produced the same complaint: an amber "WATCH … PRINTED …" row and a
 * whole model turn spent announcing a level the market passed long before
 * anyone asked. `levelWatchService.arm(plan, priceAtArm)` has refused an
 * already-dead plan this way all along — this is the same gate on the other
 * half of the harness. What still fires is a condition that becomes true while
 * the app is watching it, which is the only one that is actionable.
