/**
 * ActiveGoalChip — the one place the Chat header says which goal the seat is
 * working inside.
 *
 * The focused goal changes what the NEXT turn is offered (its tool policy is
 * intersected with the seat's at the transport), so a trader who cannot see it
 * is being shaped by a state they never chose. The chip names it and carries
 * the one control that matters: leaving it. Renders nothing when no goal is
 * focused — an empty chip slot for a desk that is not inside anything is the
 * noise this surface's header already refuses.
 *
 * The snapshot is a string, not an object: `useSyncExternalStore` compares by
 * identity, and `focusedGoal()` returns a fresh parse of the notebook every
 * time, so returning the record would re-render the header on any notebook
 * write anywhere in the app.
