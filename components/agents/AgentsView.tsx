/**
 * AgentsView — the Chat surface, not a roster that bounces you somewhere
 * else (WS-6). Reached from the nav as "Chat"; the surface id and every
 * testid still say `agents`, because a dozen gates pin them independently of
 * the label.
 *
 * Three regions, mirroring the reference: a conversation rail, a main pane,
 * and one pill composer.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO STORES, ONE THREAD — this banner used to claim the opposite.
 *
 *  - this surface reads App's `messages` (useConversations) and slices it
 *    with `utils/agentThreads`;
 *  - the Chart AI dock reads and writes `services/trade/chatStore.ts`, a
 *    module singleton that survives unmount so a running stream is not
 *    aborted by a surface switch.
 *
 * Two row SHAPES, one thread: `startEntryMirror` (`services/trade/chatTurnMirror.ts`)
 * projects the dock's live entry into the conversation under the SAME id, and
 * `liveEntryFromMessage` (`services/trade/chatSessions.ts:491`) carries `Message.isStreaming`
 * back, so a Chat-surface run keeps its activity line when the trader hops.
 * The old banner ("DO NOT SHARE A STORE TODAY") was true of the arrays and
 * false of the thread, which is the unit the trader sees.
 * A conversation opened here and on the Chart surface is one conversation;
 * `docs/app-flow.md` states the contract (its unit suite went with the suite, 2026-10-23).
 *
 *  - a send routes on WHAT IS SELECTED, not on a mode switch (there is no
 *    switch any more): a bot answers through `runUserBotTurn`, the same
 *    transport the DM mailbox uses; nothing selected hands the text to
 *    `handleSendMessage` — the real pipeline, so the desk tools and memory
 *    run exactly as they do from the dock, and the verdict
 *    comes back as an ordinary message in the same array.
 *
 * Rooms delegate to App's existing GroupChatView element rather than
 * reimplementing the round runner.
