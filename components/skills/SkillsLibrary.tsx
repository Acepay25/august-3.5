// The skill library: the Studio, the trade plans it writes, and the forged-tool
// queue.
//
// It has had three homes. A full-screen surface in the rail (two ways to reach
// one library with two chrome treatments), then Settings → Skills under a
// "Customize" shortcut, and now the Skills tab of the Knowledge surface — which
// is where the target plan recorded it (`docs/plan/open-items.md` §5 Q2:
// one view, Skills and Learn as tabs, not two rail rows). The file moved out of
// `settings/tabs/` with it, because a component that belongs to no dialog
// should not live in one.
//
// The Studio is `flex h-full` with its own scroll, so it gets a measured box
// rather than the surrounding column's auto height — otherwise it collapses to
// its own header.
//
// THE SHAPE, from the reference's Customize → Skills page: a page title, then
// the primary list, then the SECONDARY groups as category rows — the group's
// name in muted text with a raised pill beside it, saying what the group
// actually holds. The reference's own second row ("Agentic-Trading" with a
// "System" pill) is that shape, and the two groups below the Studio are
// August's version of it: a name, and a pill that names the fact a reader
// would otherwise have to dig the subtitle out for.
