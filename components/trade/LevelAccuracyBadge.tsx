/**
 * How the model's drawn levels have actually done.
 *
 * `levelAccuracy` shipped model-facing: the seat is told its own standing in
 * the receipt of its next draw. The USER never saw it, which made a real
 * measurement invisible to the one person who could act on it — "this seat
 * draws levels the market ignores" is something you can only fix by switching
 * the model, and you cannot know that without seeing the number.
 *
 * Session-scoped, not per-model, and the reason is a data limitation rather
 * than a design choice: `ChartDrawing` carries no seat or provider stamp, so
 * there is nothing to group by. That is also what makes the multi-model layer
 * work a schema change instead of a rendering change, and it is worth saying
 * out loud rather than shipping a per-model label that cannot be correct.
 *
 * Silent when nothing is judgeable. A badge reading "0 of 0" implies a failing
 * model when it is an empty sample, and a badge that appears and disappears is
 * noise; the model-facing side made the same call for the same reason.
