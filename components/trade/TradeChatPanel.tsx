/**
 * TradeChatPanel — the Chart AI dock on the trade surface. EVERY message
 * carries a freshly fetched, code-calculated market packet, and the model can
 * pull even more itself through the desk tools: get_market_packet (the full
 * hybrid pull), get_all_timeframes (every timeframe + book/funding/OI at
 * once), get_chart_view (candles + live mark + verdict levels + the
 * order book + the user's own drawings), and the GROWTH set —
 * write_memory_note / get_notebook_map / propose_skill / revise_skill /
 * amend_memory / forge_tool — so the model can create, update and edit its
 * own memory, skills and tools right from this chat (proposals still need the
 * human's approval in Settings / the Learn surface's Coach tab; visible status rows show
 * every side-effect). It can also DRAW on the live chart exactly like the
 * user: mark_trade_levels lays an Entry/SL/TP plan as labeled lines,
 * draw_on_chart adds a trendline/ray/zone, clear_chart_drawings wipes them —
 * the model's marks render on the canvas and flow back into its own context.
 *
 * The composer mirrors the reference agent client: a model selector, a +
 * attach button (files + images), a chart-screenshot button (the model sees
 * the chart as an image AND the image renders in the transcript), and a
 * thinking-effort toggle (Off → Max). AI answers stream with a real
 * collapsible Thinking row and fade in as text lands.
 *
 * Sessions: parallel chats persisted per user (new / switch / delete). A
 * session is SOLO (one model, optionally bound to a roster bot persona),
 * a PANEL (up to 5 models that see each other's turns, can DM each other
 * through the desk mailbox, and close with one synthesized answer), or an
 * ANALYSIS run (the full ensemble pipeline — hybrid intelligence, debate,
 * verdict — launched from this chat and answered back into it). The whole
 * dock is drag-resizable, collapsible to a rail, and expandable full width.
 *
 * The turn orchestration itself (send / runSeatTurn / runFullAnalysis /
 * runHarnessTurn / buildContextBlock / executePanelTool) is service-shaped:
 * it lives in `services/trade/chatTurnRunner.ts` and never touches JSX —
 * this file is the shell that subscribes to the session store, renders the
 * header, transcript and composer, and hands the runner its deps.
 *
 * No order execution — this is the copilot read of the tape, not a button.
