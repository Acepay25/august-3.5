/**
 * ChatWorkTimeline — one AI entry's ZCode-style work timeline: the reasoning
 * stream interleaved with the desk-tool rounds that interrupted it, folded
 * into a single "Analyzed for Ns" row, plus the model's side-effect status
 * rows. Extracted from TradeChatPanel unchanged (it was an inline IIFE).
 *
 * The `[Desk tools] …` mirrors inside the reasoning text are the cut points,
 * so consecutive tool events group into ONE ToolActivityRow whose rows pair
 * call→result (a `calling…` line updates to `ok` in place, never a second
 * line). Reads only the entry it is given — no dock state.
