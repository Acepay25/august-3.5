/**
 * RunBusyBadge — "this is still running".
 *
 * A run now survives a conversation switch (E-45: the run belongs to the
 * conversation it was typed in, and a switch moves the view). That makes a
 * state the app must be able to SHOW: a thread you are not looking at is
 * still thinking, and a thread that says nothing about it reads as a hang.
 *
 * WHY IT READS THE STORE: the runs live in `services/trade/chatStore.ts`'s
 * conversation-keyed registry, and the badge is rendered by components the App
 * does not thread props into. The store's snapshot is the only channel that
 * reaches them — the same reason the dock's own busy state lives there.
 *
 * WHY THE WORD AND THE COLOUR COME FROM ONE PLACE: `utils/runStatus.ts` is the
 * run-status vocabulary ("one colour+word per state"), and AGENTS.md is
 * explicit — *"Never hardcode a status colour in a component."* So the dot's
 * class is read out of the vocabulary, not typed here.
 *
 * The badge is DECORATIVE: it is `aria-hidden`, because the state must also
 * be in the host's accessible name (a dot a screen reader cannot read is not
 * an announcement). The host appends the sentence — see `SurfaceMenuList`.
