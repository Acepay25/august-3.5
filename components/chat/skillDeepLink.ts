/**
 * Skill deep link — the small live half of what used to be
 * `SkillCitationChips`, in both directions.
 *
 * Tapping a skill anywhere (the provenance strip, a card) has to open that
 * skill's detail in the Studio. The Studio may not be mounted yet when the tap
 * lands — opening it is what mounts it — so the slug is parked here as well as
 * broadcast, and the Studio consumes it on mount.
 *
 * "Try in chat" is the same problem reversed: the Chart AI dock owns the only
 * composer, surfaces render exclusively, and the Studio's "Try in chat" closes
 * the surface it is on to reach it. An event alone therefore lands on nothing,
 * which is why a tap used to look like a dead button.
