/**
 * SkillsCatalog — the reference Customize → Skills screen, on August's own data.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: a second place to approve a draft. The skill-draft path is
 * the Coach inbox (`probe-skill-approval.cjs` drives it byte-for-byte), and a
 * sixth approval surface is the exact information-architecture defect the
 * 2026-10-07 audit named. This is a BROWSER: it lists the roster, filters it,
 * and routes elsewhere for anything that changes a belief.
 *
 * Every field rendered here is real, none invented:
 *   name        ← the file slug
 *   description ← `SkillMeta.description`
 *   checkmark   ← `skillEnabledFlag(meta)` — the ONE place `enabled` is derived.
 *                 Suspension is `enabled:false` + `meta.suspendedAt`, NOT a
 *                 fourth `SkillStatus`, so this must never be derived a second
 *                 way or an unrelated attribution write silently un-suspends.
 *   tabs        ← `family` (falling back to `kind`), a real partition of the
 *                 roster. A tab with zero skills is not drawn at all — the
 *                 decorative-group defect this screen exists to avoid.
 *
 * THE REFERENCE, AND WHAT AUGUST KNOWS INSTEAD
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * The reference draws a catalogue: a title and a one-line subtitle, a header
 * row carrying search / refresh / settings / Add, an "Installed" heading over a
 * two-column grid of cards (a coloured icon tile, the name, a one-line muted
 * description, a checkmark at the right edge), and then a category row — the
 * category's name in muted text with a raised "System" pill beside it.
 *
 * August has no plugins, so it has no plugin-provided category to repeat the
 * installed list under. The one provenance axis it DOES have is `prior`:
 * `prior: 'book'` is the vetted starter shelf that ships with the app. That
 * is the reference's "System", so it gets the reference's badge — and it gets
 * its OWN category row rather than a second copy of the same cards, because
 * the same skill printed twice under two headings is a duplicate, not a
 * grouping.
 *
 * The reference's checkmark means ONE thing: this skill is available. August
 * has three honest answers to that question, so it has three marks, and the
 * two that are not "yes" say WHICH no they are (`skillAvailability` below).
 * A check on a suspended rule would be a lie the trader cannot see through.
