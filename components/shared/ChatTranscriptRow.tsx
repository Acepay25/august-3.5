/**
 * One transcript row, shared by the Chart AI dock and the Chat surface.
 *
 * The dock already had this furniture — markdown body, Thought rows, desk-tool
 * activity, side-effect status rows, copy, key levels, the verdict — and the
 * Chat surface was still a bare `{m.text}` div. Rather than write it twice,
 * both now render this over their own row model (see `ChatRowView`).
 *
 * Two things are honestly approximate and say so at the call site rather than
 * faking:
 *
 *  - **Tool and reasoning are separate blocks here.** The dock interleaves
 *    tool calls INTO the reasoning stream via a `[Desk tools]` marker the
 *    provider emits mid-answer. A settled pipeline `Message` has no single
 *    ordered stream — the trace and the tool trail are independent
 *    collections — so they render as their own rows.
 *  - **The tool trail is a list, and it survives the turn.** `Message.toolEvents`
 *    is one entry per line — the settled record of what the desk called — and
 *    `Message.toolIds` is the payload id for each of those lines, so a row can
 *    open onto the REAL output the tool returned. `Message.liveToolEvents` is
 *    the capped, newline-joined LIVE feed: it is what a filling bubble shows,
 *    and it is the fallback for rows written before the trail existed.
