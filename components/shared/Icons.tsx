/**
 * The icon layer — the ONE place feature code imports icons from.
 *
 * Three things live here and the split is deliberate:
 *
 * 1. Legacy aliases below (`Bot as BotIcon`). ~64 names kept for the files
 *    that have imported them since the layer was introduced. Do not remove one
 *    to "tidy" this file — a rename is a breaking change with no payoff, and
 *    the alias and the plain name below are the same component either way.
 *
 * 2. The canonical surface below: every lucide name this app uses, re-exported
 *    VERBATIM so a caller writes the same identifier lucide documents. The
 *    rule this encodes is about WHERE an icon comes from, not what it is
 *    called — importing through here means the size set and stroke weight are
 *    one decision in one file, instead of 77 feature files each reaching past
 *    it into the library.
 *
 * 3. `LoadingIcon`, the one wrapped icon.
 *
 * `SearchIcon` and `ChevronDownIcon` are deliberately absent from (2): the
 * legacy aliases already publish exactly those names, and two exports of one
 * name is a compile error. Callers wanting that spelling get the identical
 * component from (1).
 *
 * Identity graphics are NOT icons and do not come from here: bot avatars
 * (`BotFace`, `PixelSeat`, `pixelAvatars`), sparklines, donut charts and the
 * brand wordmark are data or identity, governed by their own palettes.
