/**
 * InterruptedRunNotice — the "Run stopped" card, shared by the Agents surface
 * row (ChatTranscriptRow) and the Chart AI dock list (ChatTranscriptList),
 * which used to carry two drifting copies of the same furniture.
 *
 * Rendered only with at least ONE handler: a "Run stopped" label with no
 * button beside it is a dead notice — it names a problem and offers no way
 * out, which is worse than saying nothing.
 *
 * The reference draws it as a CARD with the two ways out as raised chips on
 * the right — the same furniture it uses for a file it hands back. August
 * had a bare row of ghost buttons, which reads as a caption on the answer
 * rather than as the place the run stopped.
