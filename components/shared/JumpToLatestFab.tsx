/**
 * JumpToLatestFab — the ONE control that returns the trader to the newest row.
 *
 * It exists because the two conversation homes had two different answers to
 * the same question, and one of them had none at all: the Chat surface grew a
 * "↓ Latest" pill when the palette's jump action was deleted, and the Chart AI
 * dock — the narrower surface, with the longer turns — never got one. A
 * trader reading up the dock's transcript had no way back to the answer that
 * was still arriving.
 *
 * So there is one control, and both homes mount it.
 *
 * Two states, one button:
 *
 *  - **A turn is running.** The control shows an INDETERMINATE ring — a
 *    spinning dashed circle, not a percentage. A desk turn has no denominator
 *    anyone could honestly draw: the model may call three tools or forty, and
 *    a ring that claimed "60% done" would be a number the app made up. The
 *    ring says "the desk is working" and nothing more, which is all it knows.
 *  - **The trader has scrolled away.** The control shows the arrow, and one
 *    click returns. The follow-the-bottom behaviour already refuses to fight a
 *    trader who scrolled up to read, so this is the way back — deliberately
 *    explicit, because a transcript that moves on its own is a transcript you
 *    cannot read.
 *
 * It is a FAB: circular, floating above the transcript's bottom-right corner,
 * and out of the way until it has something to say.
